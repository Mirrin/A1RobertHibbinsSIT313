The intended purpose of this Application is for project 2 in Sit313
This application was never fully compiled

I wanted to make an application to Store list items which could edited on the fly with ease of access prompts and buttons 
it would allow the user to add an item and list a discription in a scroll list view, the secondary function i wanted to implement was the calculator. I never achieved a stable working version that would build due to my software
not functioning properly despite many attempts and trouble shooting this,

MVVM 
SQL data Base 
Simplistic design 
please refer to videos on templates and mock layouts and see source code within these files for attempts made.
